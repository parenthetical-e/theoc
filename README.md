A study of oscillatory coding.

# Background
There are two questions about neural oscillations whose answers are very much intertwined, and important. 

1. is there a consistent neural code in use when oscillations encode a stimulus? 
2. how does this code interact with oscillation's natural rhythmicity, and its information flow? 

We look at the ratecode, using painfully simple [LNP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-nonlinear-Poisson_cascade_model) models.

# Usage
See the `Makefile` for all experiments.

# Dependencies
