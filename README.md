# theoc
A study of oscillatory coding.

# Background
There are two questions about neural oscillations whose answers are very much intertwined, and important. 

1. is there a consistent neural code in use when oscillations encode a stimulus? 
2. how does this code interact with oscillation's natural rhythmicity, and its information flow? 

# Usage
See the `Makefile` for all experiments.

# Dependencies
TODO
