A study of oscillatory coding and its cost and benefits.

This is the simulation code for,

Peterson, E. J. & Voytek, B. Costs and benefits of using rhythmic rate codes. http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.04.24.441276 (2021) doi:10.1101/2021.04.24.441276.

# Background
There are two questions about neural oscillations whose answers are very much intertwined, and important. 

1. is there a consistent neural code in use when oscillations encode a stimulus? 
2. how does this code interact with oscillation's natural rhythmicity, and its information flow? 

We look at the ratecode, using painfully simple [LNP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-nonlinear-Poisson_cascade_model) models.
